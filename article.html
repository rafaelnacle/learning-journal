            <p class="hero-text">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've
              made the big jump
              over
              to
              the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h3 class="article-topic-title">How I stay commited to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to
              create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my
              journey with the world.</p>

            <h3 class="article-topic-title">How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
              learning.
              After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
              summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
            <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
              helping
              others learn and stay motivated.</p>
