                made the big jump
                over
                to
                the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h3 class="about-topic-title">How I stay commited to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to
              create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my
              journey with the world.</p>

            <h3 class="about-topic-title">How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
              learning.
              After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
              summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
            <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
              helping
              others learn and stay motivated.</p>
